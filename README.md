# ECommerce Backend Template - ASP.NET Core & Entity Framework Core
## Project Overview:

This is a flexible and scalable backend template for an eCommerce application built using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. Designed with SOLID principles in mind, this template provides a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up an online store backend, with support for SQLite as the database. The architecture is modular and easily extendable, allowing developers to customize and adapt the project to their specific needs.

## Key Features:

* **Entity Framework Core Integration**: Utilize EF Core for data management with full support for SQLite, allowing easy migration and database management.
* **Modular Architecture**: The project is divided into distinct modules (Products, Users, Orders, and OrderItems), making it easy to manage and extend.
* **AutoMapper Integration**: Simplifies the mapping between Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and database models, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Includes custom middleware for centralized exception handling, ensuring that all errors are logged and handled gracefully.
* **CRUD Operations**: Fully implemented CRUD operations for managing products, users, orders, and order items, providing a complete backend solution for an online store.
* **DTO Validation**: Ensures that data integrity is maintained by validating DTOs before they are processed by the backend.
* **Ready for Deployment**: The template is ready for deployment on any platform that supports .NET, with easy-to-use configuration files.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Apply migrations to set up the database.
3. Start building your custom eCommerce solution by extending and modifying the provided modules.
4. Deploy the application on your preferred hosting environment.

## Technologies Used:

* ASP.NET Core: For building a robust, cross-platform web API.
* Entity Framework Core: As an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to handle database operations.
* SQLite: For lightweight, serverless database management.
* AutoMapper: To simplify the mapping between models and DTOs.

This template is perfect for developers looking to kickstart their eCommerce project with a clean, organized, and extensible backend structure. Whether you're a beginner looking for a well-documented starting point or an experienced developer seeking a solid foundation to build upon, this template has you covered.
